# Agent Guide for pgconfig

Essential commands, structure, and patterns for AI agents.

## Essential Commands

```bash
just web          # Build the web app, which the server embeds
just test         # Web tests, then cargo test (goldens included)
just lint         # cargo fmt --check and cargo clippy -D warnings
just run          # Serve the API, the web app, and MCP on :3000
just check-conf   # Load a generated config in PostgreSQL (needs Docker)
just release-build  # Rehearse the release build for Linux and macOS
```

`mise.toml` lists every tool the repository uses: Rust, Node, just, and the
release tooling. `mise install` sets them up. Do not
add another tool manager, such as Nix. Run commands through `mise exec --`
when the tools are not on the `PATH`.

```

## Code Patterns

- **Rust**, edition 2024, one Cargo workspace. `rustfmt.toml` sets
  `max_width = 100`.
- **axum** for HTTP, **clap** for the CLI, **utoipa** for OpenAPI, **rmcp** for
  MCP.
- **English Language**: All code comments, documentation, and variable names must be in English.
- `crates/pgconfig/src/rules.rs` is the one place values are computed. `tune`
  and the `v1` module both start from it.
- `tune` takes a Tuning Request and returns recommendations with reasons,
  assumptions, and warnings. Use the domain terms: Tuning Request, Tuning
  Recommendation, Tuning Assumption, PostgreSQL Version, PostgreSQL Major
  Version.
- The `v1` module reproduces REST v1 and `pgconfigctl`, known defects included.
  Read `docs/adr/0001-rust-engine-with-v1-frozen-by-goldens.md` before
  changing it.
- `rules.yml`, `pg-docs.yml`, and `parameters/` are compiled into the crate by
  its `build.rs`. No YAML is parsed at run time.
- Three v1 output formats besides JSON: `conf`, `alter_system`, `stackgres`.

## Testing

- `cargo test` runs the unit tests and replays every golden against the Rust
  server and CLI. `tests/golden/README.md` explains the goldens.
- A change to a rule must come with re-recorded goldens. Never edit a golden
  by hand, and never weaken one to make a test pass.
- The server tests need the web bundle: run `just web` first. `cargo test`
  fails with `the web bundle is missing` when you have not.
- `crates/pgconfig/tests/snapshots` holds `insta` snapshots of full results.
- CI: `cover.yml` (Verify), `integration.yml` (the generated config loads in
  PostgreSQL 9.5 to 18 and 19 beta), `mcp-conformance.yml`.

## Adding a New Rule

1. Add the calculation to `compute` in `crates/pgconfig/src/rules.rs`, and the
   setting to `Computed` and `Computed::groups`. A setting the release lacks
   is `None`, never zero.
2. Add its reason in `crates/pgconfig/src/reasons.rs`.
3. Write the test first, in `crates/pgconfig/tests/tuning.rs`.
4. Update `rules.yml` if the rule needs metadata. `pg-docs.yml` is frozen, so
   a parameter it lacks gets an empty `show_doc` entry in REST v1: raise that
   with the user before adding one.
5. Record the goldens again and review the diff. A rule change alters REST v1
   output, so it needs a changeset.

## MCP

`docs/mcp.md` is the public contract of `/mcp`. Change it with the code, and
keep the server stateless and read-only.

## CI/CD

- **cover.yml**: release config checks, the web and Rust test suite, and a
  build on macOS and Windows
- **integration.yml**: loads the generated config in PostgreSQL 9.5 to 18 and 19 beta
- **mcp-conformance.yml**: the official MCP conformance suite, pinned
- **changesets.yml**: on `main`, opens or updates the Changesets version PR;
  merging it tags `v<version>` and calls `release.yml`
- **release.yml**: builds every target, then publishes with GoReleaser:
  binaries, deb and rpm packages, and Docker images, using the tag's
  `CHANGELOG.md` entry as release notes
- **pr-title.yml**: validates pull request titles as Conventional Commits

## Commit Conventions

Follow commit conventions from `~/.claude/pgconfig.md`:

```
<type>: <subject line (max 50 chars)>

<body wrapped at 80 cols, focus on WHY not WHAT>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`, `test`, `style`, `ci`,
`build`, `perf`, `revert`

Rules:
- Title ≤50 chars, imperative mood ("fix" not "fixed").
- Body wrapped at 80 cols, focus on WHY.
- Use `feat` only for user-facing product capabilities. Release automation,
  workflows, and other CI/CD infrastructure must use `ci`.
- Add a changeset (`npm run changeset`) for each user-visible change and commit
  it with the change. CI and docs-only changes need none. See
  `docs/releases.md`.
- Sign‑off required (`-s`).
- **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN**: AI attribution footers (e.g., "Generated with Crush", "Assisted by...").
- **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN**: Adding "Co-authored-by" unless explicitly requested by the user.
- **English Only**: Commit messages must be in English.
- **Breaking changes require explicit approval**: Agents must never choose a
  `major` changeset, add `!` to a commit/PR type, or add a `BREAKING CHANGE:`
  footer unless the user explicitly requests a breaking change or major release.
  A large change is not necessarily a breaking change; when in doubt, use a
  non-breaking type and ask the user.

## Gotchas

1. **Web before cargo**: the server embeds `web/dist`, which is not committed.
2. **REST v1 is frozen**: its defaults, error texts, and HTTP 500 for invalid
   input are pinned by the goldens. Fix v1 behavior in a new API version.
3. **Byte parsing**: v1 is permissive (`2GB`, `2gb`, a bare number means
   bytes). `tune` is strict and requires a unit.
4. **PostgreSQL version defaults**: default is 18, supported 9.1 to 19. Version 19 is beta.
5. **AIO parameters**: `io_method` is available from 18. Only 18 emits
   `io_workers`, scaled by profile and capped at 32. From 19, emit the native
   dynamic pool defaults: `io_min_workers=2`, `io_max_workers=8`. Cap
   `io_max_combine_limit` at 16 blocks on Windows for 19. The 19 pgBadger
   preset also needs `log_autoanalyze_min_duration=0`.
6. **Float arithmetic**: the memory formulas run in `f32` in the order Go ran
   them. Reordering an operation changes outputs.
7. **Parameter docs are generated**: `parameters/` changes only through the
   extractor. See the `update-parameter-docs` skill below.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues and specs for this repository live in GitHub Issues. See
`docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

This repository uses the default triage labels. See
`docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.
